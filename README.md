# PhaserJSIntroApp
The first of many trials towards mastering Phaser JS. Bao's journey to the realm of game programing.

----------------------------------------------------------

#Why did I choose Phaser?

- Already working on a full JS game engine and want to gain more experience whether or not I am using a engine made or creating one. Game development comes from all forms.

- Capabilities for setting up major game server enviorments. Can be quite handy, so its a selling point for me and server hosting for large number of players in the future.

- Mobile platform conversion ready. I have a smartphone, why not be able to spawn some creations for the fun of it, maybe a better Lords? 

- IMPORTANTLY JS. Well, at least for me, I want explore JS as my main platform, more experience the better. 

- Node.JS as well, I admit my coding experience as of July 14th, 2017 isn't quite where I would want it to be. Messing with Node.JS will be great addition to the work to come later on.

- Well, I think it will be fun!
