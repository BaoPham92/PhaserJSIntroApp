# PhaserJSIntroApp
The first of many trials towards mastering Phaser JS. Bao's journey to the realm of game programing.

=> Why did I choose Phaser? <=

LastUpdated = [July 14th, 2017]

- Already working on a full JS game engine and want to gain more experience whether or not I am using a engine made or creating one. Game development comes from all forms.

- Capabilities for setting up major game server enviorments. Can be quite handy, so its a selling point for me and server hosting for large number of players in the future.

- Mobile platform conversion ready. I have a smartphone, why not be able to spawn some creations for the fun of it, maybe a better Lords? 

- IMPORTANTLY JS. Well, at least for me, I want explore JS as my main platform, more experience the better. 

- Node.JS as well, I admit my coding experience as of July 14th, 2017 isn't quite where I would want it to be. Messing with Node.JS will be great addition to the work to come later on.

- Well, I think it will be fun!

* At first i actually thought about just following a guide to familiarize myself with the engine. However after reading the side notes whilst setting my enviroment for Phaser JS, I learned that it is best to probably follow their online libary for basics, example codes, etc. Everything I need when understanding mechanics from the basics to advanced stages of Phaser Mastery.

* From here will be the documentations from the libray Phaser has provided for newcomers. This will be me following instructions and lab testing for mechanics, enviroments, to particles, etc.
